= Local Build

It is possible to create a local manual in HTML format using
Antora. This generates a complete, standalone plugin manual.

This requires that NodeJS and Antora is installed, see
https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/

With with antora installed build is performed in the
_manual_ directory  using

    $ antora site.yml

This generates output in the _docs_ directory. Check the results
by pointing the web browser to _docs/index.html_

If there is a need to publish the generated docs the site.yml file
needs to be patched. See the Antora documentation; site.yml is a
_playbook_ in Antora parlance.
