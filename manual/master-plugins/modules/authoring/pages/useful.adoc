* *Stop ci building when adding manuals*

Add [skip ci] [skip appveyor] at the top of the commit message. This does not stop circleci builds at present, although the build does not result in a beta or master package. It generates an alpha.

* *Including images in PDF made using asciidoctor-pdf*

* *Creating a thumbnail, linked image*

For a smaller thumbnail that is linked to the larger (double-click) image:

    image::foo.png["Foo comment",width=550,link="_images/foo.png"]


* *Finding broken links*

Under "build the site with antora" Full Linkcheck
I see a number of missing links.
There are a lot of links to cruiser's forum which still work.
I am trying to find the locations in the text for these.
How would one do that?

They are straight html link, right? Just do `git grep https://www.cruisersforum.com`,
that gives you the matches and files. Or use `git grep -l` which just returns a list of
files containing the link.

    Rick@Dart MINGW64 ~/documents/github/development/modules/ROOT/pages (main)
    $ grep https://www.cruisersforum.com/

and cursor is just blinking.  This is using Windows Bash prompt.

grep reads by default from stdin... type control-C to get out of this. Then use the correct
command `git grep` which by default searches from current dir.

* *Finding unresolved Antora xrefs*

Unresolved xref: links are rendered with a red font in HTML. Such links can be
found after making a local build using

    $ grep -r "page unresolved" docs


* *Remove execute permissions from files in windows*

Windows occasionally adds execute permissions to source files. Although invisible on
windows, they are a pain in Linux and MacOS and should be removed using:

    git update-index --chmod=-x <file>
