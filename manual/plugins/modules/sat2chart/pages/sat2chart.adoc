== Use of ooREX Language

Paul Higgins uses the ooRexx language in creating Sat2Chart. For Sat2Chart to
run it needs the ooRexx interpreter installed on the machine (Paul used
to work for IBM). Sat2Chart intallation checks if ooRexx has been
downloaded and installed. If not you are prompted to do so.

ooRexx is an interpreter language. That means the human readable source
code is not compiled to machine code to an executable and this
executable is started but the ooRexx code is given to the interpreter
which translate it to machine code during startup. That is nice for
small programs and test them on the fly.

== Description & Process

This is a technique for putting charts into OpenCPN with a minimum number of steps and/or geeky user interfaces. Some processes involve using the ge2kap plugin, which is installed in OpenCPN as part of the installation of 
sat2chart. Remember to enable the ge2kap plugin in OpenCPN.

Follow the instructions in the help file or use the tutorials in the program.
